'''
Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable:
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
Write one line of Python that takes this list a and
makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

inputlist = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
newlist = []
for num in inputlist:
    if num%2 == 0:
        newlist.append(num)
    else:
        continue
print(newlist)

# As a list comprehension
b = [num for num in inputlist if num%2 == 0]
print(b)
